The Reaction Tester is a simple web application that tests your reaction time. When you open the HTML file in a web browser, it displays a shape (either a square or a circle) in a random position and color. Your goal is to click on the shape as quickly as possible. Once you click on the shape, it disappears, and the time taken to react is displayed on the page next to "Time Taken". The application then generates another shape after a random delay, and the process repeats. The shape's appearance, including size, color, and shape type, is dynamically generated using JavaScript. You can customize the appearance and behavior of the shape by modifying the CSS and JavaScript code. Adjust the size, color, and delay parameters to make the application suit your preferences. Have fun testing your reaction time!
